              "' Unterscheidung between data lakehouse and data warehouse? A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores data in a structured format, making it easy to access and analyze. A data lakehouse, on the other hand, is a repository that stores raw, unprocessed data in its native format, allowing for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and processed.\\n\\nA data warehouse is designed to support fast query performance by optimizing data storage and retrieval, while a data lakehouse prioritizes storing large amounts of raw data at scale. In summary, a data warehouse is optimized for query performance and supports complex business intelligence workloads, while a data lakehouse is optimized for storing large volumes of raw data and supporting big data analytics workloads.\\n\\nHere are some key differences between a data warehouse and a data lakehouse:\\n\\n1. Structure: A data warehouse stores data in a structured format, with well-defined schemas and tables, while a data lakehouse stores data in its raw, unprocessed form.\\n2. Data processing: A data warehouse is designed to support fast query performance by optimizing data storage and retrieval, while a data lakehouse allows for more flexibility in how the data can be analyzed and processed.\\n3. Scalability: A data warehouse is typically limited in scale due to the need for structured data, while a data lakehouse can handle very large volumes of raw data at scale.\\n4. Data types: A data warehouse typically stores structured data such as relational databases, while a data lakehouse stores unstructured data such as logs, IoT sensor data, or social media feeds.\\n5. Query patterns: A data warehouse is optimized for complex business intelligence queries, while a data lakehouse is optimized for big data analytics queries that involve multiple data sources and complex data transformations.\\n6. Cost: A data warehouse typically has higher costs associated with maintaining and managing the structure of the data, while a data lakehouse can have lower costs due to the lack of structure and the ability to store data in its raw form.\\n7. Governance: A data warehouse typically has more governance around data quality and security, while a data lakehouse may have less governance due to the raw nature of the data.\\n8.

            "8. Constructed a pipeline using YOLO v5 to detect and classify defective vehicle number plates as scratched or not scratched, and employed U-Net to generate segmentation masks for damage analysis.\n",
            "9. Integrated EasyOCR to extract and digitize text from detected number plates, automating information processing.\n",
            "10. Delivered an F1 score of 0.91 for the classification task and 0.78 for the segmentation task, demonstrating high accuracy.\n"
