### Problem Statement
The application addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful insights from PDF documents, which are often difficult to query directly. By converting the document's text into embeddings and using a large language model, users can ask context-aware questions and receive precise answers. The solution also supports efficient handling of large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience.

## Project Description
The **AI-PDF-Question-Answering** project provides a streamlined interface for extracting and querying the content of PDF documents. Users can upload a PDF file, have its content extracted, and ask questions about its content, with responses generated by an AI model. Key components include:

1. **Text Extraction:** Using tools like `PyPDFLoader`, the application extracts text from uploaded PDFs efficiently.
2. **Vectorstore Creation:** It generates embeddings for the extracted text using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, enabling semantic understanding and query matching.
3. **Conversational Interface:** Powered by the `Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` model, the system processes user queries in real-time, providing accurate and context-aware answers.
4. **Streamlit-Based UI:** The user interface is built with Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the application, upload files, and query the document.

### Features
- Upload a PDF and extract its text.
- Create embeddings for advanced semantic search.
- Handle large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks.
- Query the document and receive contextually relevant answers.
