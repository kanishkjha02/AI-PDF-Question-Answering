## Project Description
The **AI-PDF-Question-Answering** project focuses on creating an interactive application that allows users to interact with the content of a PDF document. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning technologies, the project enables users to upload PDFs, extract content, convert it into embeddings, and query the document's content through a question-answering system. This is achieved using tools like Streamlit for the user interface, libraries such as PyPDF2 and Langchain for PDF content extraction, and machine learning models like Gemini or Hugging Face transformers for embeddings and question-answering.

### Problem Statement
The application addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful insights from PDF documents, which are often difficult to query directly. By converting the document's text into embeddings and using a large language model, users can ask context-aware questions and receive precise answers. The solution also supports efficient handling of large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience.

### Features
- PDF content extraction and display.
- Embedding generation for semantic understanding.
- Context-aware question-answering using an LLM.
- Scalable and efficient handling of large PDFs.

## Hardware Dependencies
